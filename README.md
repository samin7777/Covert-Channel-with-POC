To run the code now:
On windows: Please use :- Python clientside.py -t ("kali's ip") -p (port number kali's listening on) -d (your message)
ps: please use . after  each word so that fragmentation can be possible.

on linux: python3 serverside.py -p 8000
ps: Also dont forget to set network adapter to bridged mode if kali is running inside hypervisor and window as OS. otherwise if both are inside VM then set them both to NAT.

May this will help you in doing coursework.
